ELyzer
======

A very simple processing sketch taking the Fourier transform of the audio input of the computer
and then controlling four digital outputs of an Arduino to display the spectrum.

This code replicates the demonstration of the [EL shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/el-shield-p-1287.html).

The `firmata` firmware is used for the bGeigie.
